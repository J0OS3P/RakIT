collaboration in software development. GitHub provided developers with a centralized platform to host, manage, and share their code repositories. The service gained 
widespread popularity due to its intuitive user interface, robust features, and strong community support. Since its inception, GitHub has continuously evolved and
expanded its offerings, becoming an essential tool for developers worldwide.
